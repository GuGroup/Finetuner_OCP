# Manual for fine-tuning on Open Catalyst Project (OCP).
---

#### Welcome.

#### You might be able to fine-tune OCP models with your dataset after reading this manual.

# Good luck.

## A tiny description before you start

Entire fine-tuning process can be devided into four parts.

* Set a conda environment 
* Preparing a dataset
* Make a configuration file
* Fine-tune pretrained model 

Easier than running a DFT tutorial, so you don't need to worry.

I shall be with you in every step.
